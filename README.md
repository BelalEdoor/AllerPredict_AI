# 🛒 AllerPredict AI — RAG-Based Food Product Intelligence System

## 📌 Overview
**AllerPredict AI** is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that analyzes food products based on three main criteria:

1. **Ingredient & Allergy Analysis**  
2. **Ethical Evaluation of the Company/Brand**  
3. **Product Recommendations & Alternatives**

The system retrieves structured product data from a vector database and uses an AI model to generate accurate, context-aware answers.
