AllerPredict AI is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application designed to help users analyze food products based on three core pillars:

Ingredient & Allergy Analysis

Ethical Evaluation of the Company/Brand

Product Recommendations & Alternatives

The system retrieves structured product data from a vector database and uses an AI model to generate accurate, context-aware responses to user queries.
